        This is the coding pearls group. We are 9 amazing women learning how to
        code..Introducing yourself to a group is a common practice, whether
        you're in a formal setting like a business meeting or a more casual
        gathering. Here's a basic template you can use to introduce yourself to
        a group: Greeting: Start with a friendly and polite greeting. For
        example: "Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone." Your Name:
        Clearly state your name. For example: "My name is [Your Name]." Context:
        Provide some context or background information about yourself. This
        could include your role, job title, or any relevant affiliations. For
        instance: "I'm a [Your Job Title] at [Company/Organization Name]."
        Purpose of Introduction: Mention why you are introducing yourself. Are
        you there to give a presentation, participate in a discussion, or simply
        get to know the group? For example: "I'm here today to [state the
        purpose of your presence]..." Brief Personal Information: Share a little
        about yourself, which can include your interests, experience, or any
        relevant qualifications. Keep it concise. For instance: "I have [X]
        years of experience in [Your Field], and I'm passionate about [Your
        Interests]." Engagement or Openness: Express your willingness to engage
        with the group and be open to questions or discussions. For example:
        "I'm looking forward to meeting and working with all of you. Please feel
        free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if there's anything
        I can help with." Thank the Group: Show appreciation for the opportunity
        to introduce yourself and be part of the group. For example: "Thank you
        for having me, and I'm excited to be a part of this group." Conclusion:
        Conclude with a final greeting or any additional relevant information.
        For example: "Once again, my name is [Your Name], and I'm excited to get
        started. Let's have a productive [meeting/session/event]." Remember to
        adapt your introduction based on the specific context and purpose of
        your interaction with the group. Keep it concise and engaging, and be
        sure to maintain a friendly and approachable tone.
